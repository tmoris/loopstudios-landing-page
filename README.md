## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project i have learnt
how to; access elements in the DOM, use array function in JS, use CSS grid for styling page  and create reponsive layouts


For code snippets examples, see below:

```css
.features {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-areas:
      "feature-header feature-header features-btn features-btn"
      "feature feature feature feature";
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
    gap: 0.5em;
  }
```
```js
const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.navlist-link');
navToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
document.body.classList.toggle('nav-open');
});

```
